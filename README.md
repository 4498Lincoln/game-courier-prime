## About
Courier Prime is a game which recreates the scale of World of Revertia, but in TypeScript. The game World of Revertia contained gameplay above the expectations of its players, but it had its quirks, such as bugs and the laggy experience of those editing the block code of the game. Courier Prime is a passion project that improves upon the concepts of World of Revertia.

Courier Prime's overall gameplay is not planned yet.
